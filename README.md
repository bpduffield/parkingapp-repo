# WVU Parking Application

This is an application that is for assigning parking permits as well as displaying and searching lots on the WVU campus. The data for this application is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server Database which holds user, lot, and permit information. Notable functionalies are various searches which display tables with paging, sorting, and table orientations. I utilized Google Cloud Platform's map API to provide a map of the lots as well as calculating distances and duration to each lot. On the home page, there is a chart which displays the max and current occupancies of each lot. This lot was designed to be used by a WVU parking employee.
